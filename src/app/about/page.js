              I began my career in December 2019 as a web designer at Vdesk
              Solution Pvt Ltd. During my time there, I deepened my
              understanding of web design and UI development, exploring both the
              creative and technical aspects of building user-friendly
              interfaces. I also gained experience in coding and improving user
              experience, which has fueled my passion for creating visually
              appealing and functional web designs ever since.
            </h3>
            <p className={Styles.aboutSubtitle}>
              I do more than just coding â€“ I've worked on crafting intuitive
              interfaces and enjoy enhancing user interactions. When I'm not
              busy developing, you'll find me exploring new design trends,
              optimizing performance, or collaborating on creative projects. In
              my free time, I enjoy learning new tech, playing around with
              design tools, and staying active with sports like badminton.
